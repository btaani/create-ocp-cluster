# Create OCP cluster

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, you need to create your own `install-config.yaml` using your pull secret and preferred configurations. The name of the cluster will be generated by the script and hence will be overwriten each time it is run.

`install-config.yaml` should be in the same directory as this script.


```
openshift-install create install-config /path/to/script
```

## Running the script

Simple.

```
./create-cluster.sh
```

### This script:

1. Cleans up old cluster data if any
2. Generates a cluster name in the format `<username>-<random number>`
3. Adds the cluster name to `install-config.yaml`
4. Creates the cluster in the directory `./cluster`
5. Logs in to the cluster
6. Displays login info, creation and expiry times
